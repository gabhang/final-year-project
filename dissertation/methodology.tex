\chapter{Methodology}

The focus of this project is to design and implement a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline would automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application to a production environment. In addition, a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) website is designed to integrate and test the pipeline automatically. The decision to carry out a CI/CD pipeline project was made due to the increasing popularity of automation in software development.

The project started with Agile development methodologies and transitioned to DevOps methodologies after completing the design and implementation of the CI/CD pipeline. Initially, the developer decided to switch the web application's backend from Node.js and Express.js to GO to make the project more challenging and the learn a new programming language. Basically, the idea was to build a pipeline and a website while pick up a new language.

Throughout the coding process, secondary resources were used frequently to learn GO and set up the workflow. After the website was fully designed and the features were fully implemented, the developer started designing the CI/CD pipeline. The CI part went smoothly as expected, but the CD part encountered some difficulties. The section on system evaluation will provide explanations and evidence. After attempting several solutions, the developer decided to switch back to the initial MERN stack as the focus was on designing the CI/CD pipeline.

This section will be divided into two parts: software development approaches and tools and technologies used in this project.
