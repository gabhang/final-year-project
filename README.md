# Student Grade System
This repository serves as a repository for my final year project in Atlantic Technology University. This project focuses on designing a pipeline while developing a student grade management website for implementation. This website is coded with Go language as the backend server, React.JS as front end and MongoDB as a database.

## Objectives
- Learn new GO programming language
- Design pipelines for automation
- Enhance React.JS and RESTful API skills
