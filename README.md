# Student Grade System
This repository serves as my final year project at Atlantic Technology University. The project focuses on designing a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** while developing a simple student grade management website using MERN stack with basic CRUD functionalities.

The student grade system deployed from this repository can be accessed [here](https://student-grade-system.herokuapp.com/). The website is built using **React.js** as the front-end and **MongoDB** as the database. Initially, the backend server was developed in **Go** language, but it was later changed to **Node.js** and **Express.js** due to deployment compatibility and issues. Next, **Jest** and **Supertest** were used to write tests for testing, and **Heroku** was used for deployment. Lastly, **Jira**, a project management software, is utilised to plan and track project progress as shown below with a roadmap.

## Objectives
- To demonstrate an understanding of principles and practices of continuous integration and deployment for better efficiency.
- To enhance designing and developing a scalable web application using modern front-end frameworks and back-end technologies.
- To implement best practices for software development, such as testing and documentation.
- To develop skills in project management, including project planning and tracking.

## Tools and Technologies
- **React.js** for front-end development.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js _(initially GO)_** for the server-side scripting.
- **MongoDB** for database management.
- **Git** for version control and repository management.
- **Github Actions** for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Jest** and **Supertest** for testing.
- **Heroku** for deployment.
- **Jira** for project management.
